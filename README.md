### Current interests (October, 2025)

Building on my research in Cognitive Neuroscience—where I studied how human values, decisions, and actions are internally represented—I now focus on AI Safety, particularly on understanding how misaligned internal representations in AI systems lead to unintended value preferences and behaviors. 

This challenge is likely to persist as:

- AI systems grow rapidly in capability, complexity, and diversity.
- Digital architectures are not inherently designed to align with human values and thinking processes.
- Forced alignment often induces workaround or deceptive behaviors (e.g. "scheming" AIs).
- We lack standardized methods to reliably interpret internal representations linked to model outputs.

Accordingly, my first goal is to develop principled approaches for interpreting and mitigating representational misalignment in AI systems.  

In 2025, frontier models began demonstrating new roles in enhancing human creativity and productivity (e.g. [New Chess Move Discoveries by DeepMind/Goodfire](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2406675122); [Scientific Data Interpretations by Leap Lab](https://zenodo.org/records/15693353)). That same year, [my study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17182) also uncovered hidden emotional and logical structures underlying assertive and persuasive model outputs, offering insights into effective human communication. Building on this, my second goal is to build tools that leverage frontier models to amplify human cognitive capacities.
