### Current interests (September, 2025)

Building on my research in Cognitive Neuroscience—where I studied how human values, decision-making, and actions are internally represented—I have become interested in AI Safety, particularly in understanding how misaligned internal representations in AI systems lead to unexpected values and behaviors. This challenge is likely to persist in next-generation AI systems because:

- AI capabilities are rapidly expanding, diversifying and becoming increasingly complex.
- Digital architectures are not inherently designed to align with human values.
- Forced alignment can produce unintended or workaround behaviors.
- No standardized methods exist to reliably interpret internal representations and link them to model outputs.

My goal is to develop principled approaches for interpreting these representations and mitigating alignment risks in AI systems.
